I finally solved the problem. I did cd rl_gym../gym_collision... and then  git push --set-upstream --force origin main
finally pushed the recursive module to git

        px = agent[0]
        py = agent[1]
        gx = agent[2]
        gy = agent[3]
        pref_speed = agent[4]
        radius = agent[5]
